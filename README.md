# DevOps Exercise


### Test Badge
![sortLib Test](https://github.com/K-Hannan12/COS-397-Assignment-5/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?event=push)

1. Project Overview

    This project implements a python pachake for sorting integer lists using popular sorting algorithms such as bubblesort, quicksort, and insertion sort. The goal is to apply DevOps practices, including continuous integration and continuous delivery, using tools like github Actions, pytest, flake8, and black.

2. Installation Instructions

    STEP ONE: Clone the GitHub repository
    git clone https://github.com/yourteam/repository-name.git

    STEP TWO: Install required dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    STEP THREE: Install the sorting package
    python steup.py install

Prerequisites:
python 3.9 or 3.10
package managers: pip
GitHub account to access the repository

3. Usage Guide

    After installation you may use the sorting algorithm as follows
    
    from sort_lib import bubble_sort, quick_sort, insertion_sort
    
    Example usage:
    numbers = [34, 7, 23, 32, 5, 62]
    sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)
    print(sorted_numbers)

4. Configuration

    Sorting Algorithm does not require any additional configuration
